### My first repository!

I'm Jennifer and here is my first GitHub repository.
If you see this file on my project, it's because I'm learning Git.

#### Purpose of project
In this project I 
- Practise writing README.md
- Push commits from the command line
- learn how to commit Jupyter projects (test with git_jupyter_test.ipynb)

Thanks for visiting!
